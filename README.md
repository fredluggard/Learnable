Version control is a technology that tracks changes to files and code on a website or app. It can also be used to manage changes to documents and other information.

# Explain difference between git and github:

Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories. In simple terms, you can use git without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git.

# Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull:

The key difference between git fetch and pull is that git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. The git pull command does both.

# Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it:

The git rebase command allows you to easily change a series of commits, modifying the history of your repository. You can reorder, edit, or squash commits together. Typically, you would use git rebase to: Edit previous commit messages.

# Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it:

git cherry-pick in git means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another branch. This is in contrast with other ways such as merge and rebases which normally apply many commits into another branch. git cherry-pick is just like rebasing, an advanced concept and also a powerful command.
